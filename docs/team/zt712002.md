FinanceProPlus is a Command Line Interface(CLI) application designed to aid financial agents to track their clients, 
tasks, meetings and their Companies' policies. It can also show them their upcoming forecast of things to do for the week.

**Enhancements Added**:

- Client Command Methods 
  * View
    * What it does: Allows user to view clients detailed profile, including list of all their policies.
    * Highlights: Implementation was challenging as I had to think of the design of the client class interactions with
    client policy class which is the child class of `policy`. 
  * Add
    * What it does: Allows user to add clients.
    * Highlights: It was challenging making the ID`nric` attribute akin to the primary key of a table. Other methods
    like storing this data as a hash was considered but this was used instead.
  * Delete
- Client Policy Methods and Implementation
  * What it does: Allows user to keep track of clients policy with more information such as start/expiry date and monthly premium.
  * addpolicy
     * What it does: allows user to add client policies to client.
  * updatepolicy
      * What it does: allows user to add client policies to client.
* Parser Design and implementation
    * What it does: Filters user input, then determines what command to delegate to.
    * Highlights: Challenging to design the overall parser logic and how it will interact with the child classes properly.
- List Command Methods
- List Container and LookUp Table implementation
    * What it does: ListContainer is an interface that all lists classes in the application inherits from. 
  LookUp Table is the implementation that allows all lists to be stored in the same data structure.
    * Highlights: Implementation was difficult as had to read up on how to store distinct classes with the same 
  behaviour in a data structure. Interfaces was used here as they are the most suitable for these types of challenges.
- Logger Class
    * What it does: Developers can use it to log their classes. This provides a unified configuration of what the log 
  files will look like.
- Unit Tests and Assertions
    - Wrote unit tests for all the above to hit 100% Code Coverage for non-trivial methods.
