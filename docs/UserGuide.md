## Features

### Client Features

This guide provides a complete reference for all commands related to the `client` entity. The commands are designed for rapid data entry and retrieval, allowing you to manage your client portfolio entirely from the keyboard.

### Command Syntax Legend

Before we begin, here is the syntax used in this guide:
*   `<VALUE>`: A placeholder for a value you must provide (e.g., `<NRIC>`).
*   `[...]`: Denotes an optional argument or group of arguments.

#### **1. Adding a New Client**

This command creates a new client record. The policy is optional and, if included, will be created as a "placeholder" that you can detail later using the `updatepolicy` command.

*   **Command:** `client add n/<NAME> c/<CONTACT> id/<NRIC> [p/<POLICY_NAME>]`

*   **Arguments:**
    *   `n/<NAME>`: **Required.** The full name of the client.
    *   `c/<CONTACT>`: **Required.** The client's phone number.
    *   `id/<NRIC>`: **Required.** The client's unique NRIC number (acts as a primary key).
    *   `p/<POLICY_NAME>`: *Optional.* The name of a base policy to assign to the client as a placeholder. The policy must already exist in the main policy list. Only 1 policy can be added in this command.

*   **Examples:**
    *   To add a client without an initial policy:
        ```
        client add n/John Doe c/87654321 id/S1234567A
        ```
    *   To add a client and immediately assign a placeholder policy named "HealthShield":
        ```
        client add n/Jane Smith c/11223344 id/G7654321B p/HealthShield
        ```

#### **2. Viewing a Client's Full Details**

This command displays a comprehensive, formatted view of a single client, including their personal details, all associated policy contracts, and all pending to-do items.

*   **Command:** `client view id/<NRIC>`

*   **Arguments:**
    *   `id/<NRIC>`: **Required.** The NRIC of the client you wish to view.

*   **Example:**
    ```
    client view id/S1234567A
    ```

#### **3. Listing All Clients**

This command provides a summary view of all clients currently in your portfolio, listed with a numerical index. This index is essential for deleting clients.

*   **Command:** `list client`

*   **Example:**
    ```
    list client
    ```

#### **4. Deleting a Client**

This command permanently removes a client and all their associated data (policies, to-dos) from the system.

*   **Command:** `client delete <INDEX>`

*   **Arguments:**
    *   `<INDEX>`: **Required.** The numerical index of the client to delete. **You must run `list client` first to find the correct index.**

*   **Workflow Example:**
    1.  First, list all clients to find the target's index:
        ```
        list client
        ```
        *(Output might show "1. Name: John Doe...")*

    2.  Then, use that index to delete the client:
        ```
        client delete 1
        ```

#### **5. Searching for a Client**

This command searches for and displays a specific client's basic information using their NRIC. This is useful for quickly finding a client without viewing their full details.

*   **Command:** `client search <NRIC>`

*   **Arguments:**
    *   `<NRIC>`: **Required.** The NRIC of the client you want to search for.

*   **Examples:**
    *   To search for a client with NRIC "S1234567A":
        ```
        client search S1234567A
        ```
    *   If the client is found, you'll see their basic information:
        ```
        Client found:
        Name: John Doe, Contact: 87654321, NRIC: S1234567A
        ```
    *   If no client is found with that NRIC:
        ```
        No client found with NRIC: S9999999Z
        ```

#### **6. Archiving a Client**

This command moves a client and all their associated data (policies, to-dos) from the active clients list to the archived clients list. This is useful for clients who are no longer active but whose records you want to preserve.

*   **Command:** `client archive <INDEX>`

*   **Arguments:**
    *   `<INDEX>`: **Required.** The numerical index of the client to archive. **You must run `list client` first to find the correct index.**

*   **Workflow Example:**
    1.  First, list all active clients to find the target's index:
        ```
        list client
        ```
        *(Output might show "1. Name: John Doe...")*

    2.  Then, use that index to archive the client:
        ```
        client archive 1
        ```

#### **7. Restoring a Client**

This command moves a previously archived client and all their associated data (policies, to-dos) back to the active clients list.

*   **Command:** `client restore <INDEX>`

*   **Arguments:**
    *   `<INDEX>`: **Required.** The numerical index of the archived client to restore. **You must run `list archived` first to find the correct index.**

*   **Workflow Example:**
    1.  First, list all archived clients to find the target's index:
        ```
        list archived
        ```
        *(Output might show "1. Name: John Doe...")*

    2.  Then, use that index to restore the client:
        ```
        client restore 1
        ```

#### **8. Listing Archived Clients**

This command displays all archived clients with their basic information, listed with numerical indices for restoration.

*   **Command:** `list archived`

*   **Example:**
    ```
    list archived
    ```

### Managing Client Policies

These commands allow you to manage the specific insurance contracts associated with a client.

#### **1. Adding a Detailed Policy to a Client**

This command adds a new, fully detailed insurance contract to an existing client.

*   **Command:** `client addpolicy id/<NRIC> p/<POLICY_NAME> s/<START_DATE> e/<EXPIRY_DATE> m/<PREMIUM>`

*   **Arguments:**
    *   `id/<NRIC>`: **Required.** The NRIC of the client.
    *   `p/<POLICY_NAME>`: **Required.** The name of the base policy (must exist).
    *   `s/<START_DATE>`: **Required.** The contract start date in `dd-MM-yyyy` format.
    *   `e/<EXPIRY_DATE>`: **Required.** The contract expiry date in `dd-MM-yyyy` format.
    *   `m/<PREMIUM>`: **Required.** The monthly premium amount (e.g., `150.75`).

*   **Example:**
    ```
    client addpolicy id/S1234567A p/HealthShield s/14-09-2024 e/14-09-2026 m/250.50
    ```
> **Note on Premiums:**
> *   The premium amount must have a maximum of two decimal places (e.g., `150.75` is valid, `150.755` is not).
> *   While the system supports very large numbers, please ensure the premium is a realistic value to avoid potential data overflow issues.


#### **2. Updating a Client's Policy**

This command modifies the details of an existing policy contract for a client. You only need to provide the fields you wish to change.

*   **Command:** `client updatepolicy id/<NRIC> p/<POLICY_NAME> [s/<NEW_DATE>] [e/<NEW_DATE>] [m/<NEW_PREMIUM>]`

*   **Arguments:**
    *   `id/<NRIC>` & `p/<POLICY_NAME>`: **Required** identifiers.
    *   `s/`, `e/`, `m/`: *Optional.* Provide at least one of these to update. Dates must be in `dd-MM-yyyy` format.

*   **Example:**
    *   To update only the premium and expiry date for Jane's "PremiumLife" policy:
        ```
        client updatepolicy id/G7654321B p/PremiumLife e/21-10-2060 m/375.00
        ```

#### **3. Deleting a Policy from a Client**

*   **Arguments:**
    *   `id/<NRIC>`: **Required.** The NRIC of the client.
    *   `i/<INDEX>`: **Required.** The numerical index of the policy to delete. **You must run `client view id/<NRIC>` first to see the numbered list of policies and find the correct index.**

        ```
        client view id/G7654321B
        ```        *(Output might show "1. Policy Name: HealthShield", "2. Policy Name: PremiumLife")*

If a new user needs to be added, the existing one must first be deleted.


---

#### **1. Adding the Active User**

This command registers the Financial Advisor using the system.  
Only one user can exist at any time — attempting to add another will result in an error.

```
  Here is the current user information:
  User Details:
  Name: Alex Tan
  Email: alex@example.com
  Contact: 91234567
  Representative No.: FA-001
```

#### **3. Deleting the Current User**

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?

**A**: You can transfer the entire `./data/` directory to your new computer. Place it in the same folder as the `.jar` file before running the application.

**Q**: Can I manually edit the files in the `./data/` folder?

**A**: **No.** Manually editing the storage files (e.g., `clients.txt`, `policies.txt`) is **strongly discouraged**. The files use a specific format, and any incorrect changes can lead to data corruption, causing the application to fail on startup or lose your data. Always use the application's commands to manage your information.
